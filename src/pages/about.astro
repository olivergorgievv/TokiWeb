    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>
      I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
      page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
    </p>

    <p>
      This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
      back and see how my journey is going!
    </p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
      <li>
        I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
      </li>
      {
        identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
          <li>
            Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and{" "}
            {identity.hobbies[1]}
          </li>
        )
      }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul class="flex gap-4 pt-6">
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="px-6 py-3 border rounded-lg border-gray-300 bg-gray-200 flex items-center justify-center text-center text-nowrap">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
